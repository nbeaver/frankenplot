This project used to be hosted at

http://gitorious.org/frankenplot/

but Gitorious shut down in May 2015,
and Frankenplot did not make it to the Internet Archive:

`<https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gitorious.org/frankenplot/>`_

Therefore, I've uploaded the git repo,
as well as revisions from Carlo Segre's Debian package at

http://debian-xray.iit.edu/pool/main/f/frankenplot/

and SVN here:

http://svn.csrri.iit.edu/mr-software/frankenplot/

The repo also has my own additions.
